## 👋 Hey there, I'm Dhruvi Gaur!
A tech creator with a designer’s heart and a deep curiosity for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I love turning ideas into intelligent, user-centric solutions—merging data-driven systems with aesthetic design thinking. 🎨🤖

🌟 What I'm all about:
🧠 Currently building intelligent systems using ML, NLP, and Generative AI to solve real-world problems.

🛠️ Exploring the blend of AI + UX Design to create human-first interfaces for complex AI tools.

🧪 Always experimenting with open-source, research-backed models, and creative AI workflows.

🤝 Open to collaborations on AI agents, ethical AI, and intuitive product design.

💬 Let’s talk about user-centered AI products, human-AI collaboration, and how good design can make smart tech usable!

When I’m not optimizing models or drawing flows, you’ll find me designing interfaces that speak human.
Because I believe: The smartest tech is the one you don’t have to explain.
